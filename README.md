# Calmodoro

### What is the Pomodoro Technique?

It's a time management system that alternates time spent focusing on a specific tasks with regular breaks. This typically involves three periods of work with a short break, followed by a period of work with a long break. The technique is named after the tomato-shaped timer the creator of the technique originally used, _pomodoro_ being the Italian word for tomato.

### Using Calmodoro

Click 'Start' to begin the timer. A bell will sound at the end of each work period and the break timer will automatically begin, and so on throughout the Pomodoro cycle. You can pause the timer at any time.

Users can customise the length of each work, short break and long break period in the **Time** box.
